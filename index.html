    <h1>My College Journey</h1>
    
    <p>College has been a mix of challenges and growth. I've learned to balance academics, work, and personal life while exploring new interests. One thing that stands out is how visual learning has helped me improve my communication skills. Working in groups has shown me what a real project could look like. It’s also cool to see everyone else have similar struggles and goals.</p>
    
    <p>After graduating, I want to pursue a career in <i>Interior design & Real Estate</i>. I enjoy creating visually compelling compositions and bringing ideas to life through digital art and layout design.</p>
    
    <h2>More About Me</h2>
    
    <p>An ethical value I hold dearly is <i>loyalty</i>. I believe being loyal builds trust and strengthens relationships.</p>
    
    <p>I enjoy playing video games and playing sports with friends. Its a great way to get away and have a temporary goal, even if it may be digital or just making a shot in basketball.</p>
    
    <p>My favorite food is La Bandera, a traditional Dominican dish with rice, beans, and a choice of protein. I have it like every other day, and I don't think I'll ever grow tired of it.</p>
    
    <p>Something I want people to know about me is that I'm absolutely goated, and I don't miss I always come out on top!</p>
